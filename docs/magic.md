-   [Stigmergy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy) a spontaneous,
    indirect coordination of actions, where the result of one action
    stimulates the performance of a subsequent action.  This is actually what is happening.  Natural order.  All the time.  It is the small things that matter.
