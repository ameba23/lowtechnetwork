Existing projects seem to be shifting towards using higher and higher frequencies as the bands become become more crowded and people want more bandwidth (5GHz etc).  Another approach could be to use lower frequencies and lower bandwidth, for a more robust communication solution for rural areas and less directional, allowing more ad-hoc 'random' connectivity (rather than point-to-point links) and a more inclusive network.    \n\n\nembrace the limitations\n\n\nThe physical and geographical limitations of using decentralised radio networks could actually be an advantage, encouraging us to interact locally, with a network topology which reflects directly our capability to interect physically.  There is still the possiblity of long distance communication, but the nature of the topology means you are more likely to find things which are geographically nearby.

Decentralised communication will require decentralised power.  The network must be able to operate with minimal maintainance or reliance on conventional industry.  Mainstream battery technology is favouring increasing power density regardless of battery lifetime (a small battery is able to give much power, but you can throw it away after a few years).  Whats needed is a technological shift in the opposite direction.  Bigger batteries, giving low power for a long time, which almost never need replacing.

But\nfor those of us who do, isn't it time we set up community run\nalternatives?\n\n\nProblems with existing communication networks\n\n\nGradually, the internet, which once seemed like a relatively free and\nuser-controlled system \u2013 at least compared with totally centralised\nTV/radio broadcasting, is becoming a controlled commercial space where\npeople don't trust each other and we are constantly under the eyes of\nauthorities and businesses - much like our city centres.\n\n\nCentralisation of control, censorship, privacy\n\n\nTwo examples: In feburary 2012 the non-profit website 'scroogle' which\noffered an alternative version of google (where searches were not\nrecorded) was taken down after action against it taken by google. Then\nin march 2012 google put into practice their new privacy policy, making\nusers search history available to other google owned sites. Of course\nother sites exist which provide secure web searches.\n\n\nDuring the uprising in Egypt 2011 there was an internet blackout, making\nit clear that such a communication network is valuable for organising\nsocial change but sadly rests in the hands of companies willing to\ncooperate with the authorities. Since then the US has began to develop\nan 'internet kill switch'.

The site also has an \nopen hardware\n    directory\n\n\nredecentralize.org\n a series video\n    interviews about projects which contribute to the decentralisation\n    of communication. See also their \nlist of alternative internet\n    projects\n\n\nfederation FDN\n Fedaration of associative\n    internet service providers in france\n\n\n\n\n\n\nideas for community run communication, new and old\n\n\nIn order for a community run network to become popular, it might be\nuseful to have some universal standards, and a way for different\nnetworks to link together. A small group might use high frequencies to\nget high bandwidth communication locally, but how can we connect that\ncommunication with lower frequency, longer range links to other\ncommunities? If we are going to set up some sort of repeaters or base\nstations to link groups, they need to be useful to everyone, and not\ndependent on other parts of the network. Some repeaters might be\ninstalled in vehicles or boats that move around. Or they might be\ndependent or wind or sun for power \u2013 so they cannot be always relied\nupon.\n\n\nIt is relevant here to question what is important to us in a\ncommunication network. Simply spending time with and talking to people\naround you is a very useful way to communicate. Any kind of\ncentralisation or broadcasting of information could be argued to be\ndetrimental to the autonomy of individuals and communities. when we look\nat examples in 'nature' we can see that beautiful organised structures\ncome about as the result of a large number of low level interactions.\n\n\nfood and fire\n\n\nmake food and fire, people come together and communicate.  actually it seems that the more communications technology we have, the less we do this.  a lot of people feel really isolated, even though they have worldwide communication devices.\n\n\nLanguage\n\n\nLanguage is an important communication tool. Like other aspects of our\nculture, it is becoming more homogenised and less diverse. There are\nmany examples of when a common language has been used as a way for a\nminority to have power over many, and of when speakers of other\nlanguages or dialects are oppressed. Language homogeny is a structure\nused to create a national identity and recognition of and obedience to a\nnational state. Many revolts and uprisings have been possible because of\na refusal to use the majority language. In recent times, the\nglobalisation of the market and of communications infrastructure (for\nexample the internet) mean even more homogeny of language, allowing even\nmore centralisation of control by a minorty. Of course, using a common\nlanguage improves relations between communities, but when this is forced\nor imposed my a minority there will always be some kind of communication\nbreakdown, a loss of some culture, ideas or knowledge, and somebody will\nbe more isolated. Thats not to say we should not learn popular languages\nand use them to network with far away friends, but that we must\nrecognise that divirsity of language is important in maintaining\ndecentralised social control.\n\n\n\n\nBook: 'When languages die - the extinction of the world's languages and the erosion of human knowledge' K. David Harrison 2007 Oxford University press\n\n\n\n\nstorytelling\n and folklore\n\n\nStories, tales and songs are a way to memorise ideas so they can be passed between groups\nand between generations.\n\n\nPost\n\n\nWrite a letter, and give it to someone who is travelling the direction you want it to go.  Like all communication systems, the provision of a postal service has often been a way to exert control. \n\n\nCommunity notice boards\n\n\nA simple way to communicate in a group is to leave a written or\npictorial message for others to see. A way of making it weatherproof is\nusually needed.\n\n\nPrinting\n\n\nSome would argue that the invention of the printing press, meaning that\ninformation could be mass produced, was a hindrence to our diversity of\nideas. There are no doubt problems brought about by any kind of\nmechanism which allows a minority to speak to the masses. But of course\nthey can also be very important and empowering community tools.\n\n\n\n\nToner refill - wikipedia article\n on refilling\n    photocopier or laser printer toner\n\n\nPrinter and Photocopier Troubleshooting and Repair Collection\n\n\n\n\nradio\n\n\nThe radio spectrum, like other kinds of space, has been divided into\ndiscrete parts of which the majority is resverved for authorities, military, or companies who will\nsell it back to us to use.  To use it in a genuinely decentralised way we\nmight need to disrespect the idea of bandwidth ownership.\n\n\namateur radio\n\n\n 'amateur' radio communication has\nexisted for over a hundred years. It is both a local and an\ninternational network and has often been relied upon when other\ncommunications have broken down because of disasters such as floods.\nData modulation systems such as\n\nPSK31\n can allow text services\nsimilar to email or sms, which can operate over thousands of miles on\nHF. Using the amateur bands requires a lisence and an official\n'callsign', which are relatively cheap and easy to get, but there are\nsome undesirable restrictions. For example, sending encrypted messages\nis forbidden, and the lisencing association stores personal details of\nits users and will cooperate with governments. Of course we could use\nsimilar systems illegally, but as an existing nework it has the\nadvantage of having estabilished and well documented international\nstandards, as well as infrastructure such as repeater stations. The\namateur community emphasises learning and experimentation rather than a\npractical everyday communication tool.\n\n\n\n\nAMPRNet\n Amateur packet radio\n    network, also known as hamnet, is the name given to computer\n    networks connected by amateur radio links. TCP/IP\n    (internet protocol) packet radio networks have existed since before\n    the public internet but have never been very popular, partly because\n    of bandwidth restrictions (VHF links are commonly limited to\n    9600 baud). Interestingly, radio amateurs are allocated a considerable chunk of\n    the IPv4 address space (44.0.0.0/8).\n\n\nHinternet\n on\n    noisebridge\n\n\nHigh Speed Multimedia Radio\n\n    this article looks at using 802.11 wifi on different amateur bands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow cost E-mail over HF with OFDM and turbo coding.\n This\n    project looks to be a robust long distance solution. It uses newqpsk\n    (or \nQ15X25\n) protocol with the\n    'soundmodem' software. OFDM seems to be gaining popularity in these\n    lower parts of the spectrum, but I have a bit of trouble\n    understanding this example, how can a standard HF transciever be\n    used with a new and different modulation mode?\n\n\nQRZ.com\n callsign database, also forums\n    including buying and selling amateur hardware.\n\n\nchirp\n open source, cross platform,\n    radio programming tool (software)\n\n\nThe (chinese) radio documentation project\n produce a\n    creative-commons-licensed manual for the Baofeng uv-5r, a low cost\n    vhf/uhf handheld amateur radio (2m and 70cm).

There are some\nvery cheap transmitters sold on ebay, some sold for use with arduino or\nraspberry pi (see issue 8 of \nmagpi magazine\n). The problem is that the cheaper\nones do not support channel selection, so would interfere with each\nother.\n\n\n\n\nRadiometrix\n, based in the UK, make\n    quite good quality but still fairly cheap stuff. Also some\n    transcievers with chanels selection and more high end radio modems.\n\n\nLinking an Arduino to a Radiometrix NTX2\n    Transmitter\n this\n    guide explains how to connect one of these simple transmitters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrato -antenna design\n\n\n\n\ncompanies selling radio and electronics stuff\n\n\n\n\nwimo antennen and electonik\n (de) This site\n    also has some useful help guides in many languages.\n\n\nstabo.de\n cb kit and antennas`(de)\n\n\ncbplus\n (fr)\n\n\ne44\n (fr)\n\n\nselectronic\n (fr)\n\n\nyagi.pl\n antennas and other kit for wifi, wimax,\n    gsm, umts\n\n\n\n\npirate radio broadcast\n\n\nPirate radio can be empowering for a community and is a useful tool for\ncombining art and information. The advantage is that the recievers are\ncheap and can be found everywhere. Compared to wifi networks it is much\nmore practical for recieving in more wild places, fields, gardens,\nworkshops, meaning we can be doing practical things and not stuck\nindoors, while recieving information. Of course there are legal problems with\nbroadcasting without a lisence, especially if it is done in the city.\nBut using it in isolated rural areas is something that can definately be\nexperimented with. As anyone with an FM radio can listen, it can be a\ngood way to make links with other people who live nearby.\n\n\nHowever, we must not forget that the nature of broadcast is that it remains a\none-to-many 'shut up and listen' monologue, traditionally used as an oppressive political tood, and care must be taken that\nit remains a project that everyone can participate in.\n\n\nFM systems will usually use a 1 or 2w 'exciter' to produce the modulated\nsignal and then an RF amplifier. Many modern systems, especially the\ncheaper/lower power ones have the exciter and amplifier all in one box\nor even all on one board. 'HLLY' and similar Chinese brands are like\nthis and are very cheap and simple to use. However they are not very\nhigh quality and not suitable for high power transmissions (more than\nsay 60w).  Also the more power you are using, the better antenna you need to not damage the transmitter.  Most transmitters have a built in SWR (standing wave ratio) meter to give an indication of how well the antenna is functioning and will normally switch off automatically if a dangerously high amount of power is coming back from the antenna.  Some transmitters will need an external SWR meter. \n\n\nMost low power FM transmitters run on 12v DC so are perfect for running\nfrom batteries. If you want to run from the mains electricity and dont\nhave a transformer, computer power supplies work quite well. If they are\nmodern ATX ones, you will need to connect the green wire on the\nmotherboard connector to a black wire to switch it on. Then on each\nblock of 4 wires you have yellow and black wires to give 12vDC and red\nand black to give 5vDC.\n\n\nstudio to transmitter audio bridges\n\n\nMany pirate radio stations use a 'bridge' to link the studio to a remote\ntransmitter. This is done either for security reasons (not wanting to\nget caught at the site of the transmitter) or simply to keep the\ntransmitter close to the antenna when the antenna is in a difficult to\nreach spot (remember, the hieght of the antenna greatly effects the\nrange). A bridge which gives a lot of range allows you to be very\ncreative with antenna locations, as the transmitter could be powered by\na small solar panel and battery and put in a very difficult to reach\nplace. This 'bridge' can be made in various different ways:\n\n\n\n\nUsing a very \nlong audio cable\n\n\nUsing a \nsecond, usually lower power, FM broadcast transmitter\n\n    operating on a different frequency.\n\n\nUsing transmitters from \nwireless microphones\n. Most have at least\n    200khz of bandwidth and work in 470-698mhz UHF TV spectrum (could\n    also be interesting to use for data...)\n\n\nUsing a \n\"microwave audio bridge\"\n which you can buy, often they\n    work on 2.4 GHz wifi.\n\n\nuse \nwifi routers\n and audio streaming software to make the bridge\n    (a diy version of the above).\n\n\nuse an \ninternet link\n. A computer (eg: raspberry pi) and internet\n    dongle or whatever (instructions in forum on\n    \nRadionecks\n)\n\n\nuse a \nPMR\n (walkie talkie) link. Probably would be bad audio\n    quality because of low bandwidth but maybe one could find a way to\n    have a high bandwidth bridge on PMR frequencies using multiple channels. (maybe some\n    wireless microphones do this?)\n\n\nuse \nCB\n, apparrently this has worked well for some projects.\n    Again of course the bandwidth means a loss in quality but the\n    advantage is the transmitter can be *very* far away. A possibility\n    would be to use modified CB equipment to spread the signal over\n    several channels.\n\n\nor use some other radio frequency, with Software Defined Radio or amateur stuff, we\n    can experiment...\n\n\n\n\nPirate radio links and projects\n\n\n\n\nRadionecks\n mostly london based pirate\n    radio forum. there is a lot of interesting stuff, and also a place\n    to buy and sell kit.\n\n\nMaking waves:pirate radio for actikids\n pdf zine\n\n\nComplete manual of pirate radio\n\n    pdf book, quite old and outdated information. \n\n\nsysbroadcast\n make and sell\n    high performance transmitters and amplifiers, based in france (site\n    still under construction)\n\n\nukw-senderbau.de\n sells transmitters\n    and other kit (de)\n\n\nfree radio berkeley\n 'radio action\n    training' with video guides.

The standard is\nlikely to be used by commercial internet service providers to cover\nrural areas - internet base stations could operate over a 60km radius,\nlike TV transmitters. It is the first international standard to use\n'cognitive radio' to eliminate interference with existing TV signals.\nThis makes it possible that transmission equipment will be software\ndefined, making it more adaptable for eventually being re-used by us.\n\n\n\n\nIEEE 802.22 WRAN\n\n    wikipedia article\n\n\nieee802.org/22\n official\n    IEEE site\n\n\nieee802.22 WRAN\n    standard\n\n    article on radio-electronics.com\n\n\nUK speeds up availability of 800MHz spectrum for lte\n    auction\n\n    This article shows how, in the UK, newly available spectrum is\n    auctioned off to private companies.

They are computer\ncontrolled radios, where various aspects of the radio's operation which\ntraditionally were done by analogue hardware devices, in paticular the\nmodulation and demodulation of the RF signal, are done digitally by\nsoftware. This has only recently become posibile because with radio\nfrequency high sampling rates are required and computers need to run\nfast enough to demodulate them in real time. The advantage is that software defined\nradio devices are flexible, adaptable and easy to modify. By changing the software, a single device could act as an FM transmitter, GPS reciever, digital TV decoder, VHF tranciever,\nwhatever... Of course some hardware changes (such as amplifiers or antennas) are required, but essentially it is\nsoftware which defines the behaviour as a radio device.  \n\n\nThis means that new radio protocols could be established without the need for new hardware.  But that is only the beginning.  It allows more dynamic, more flexible use of the radio spectrum.  When there is little radio traffic (in unpopular places or at unpopular times) we can use more bandwith, reacting dynamically to interference.  When connectivity is good we can increase frequency and decrease power consumption.  When powered by solar or wind, we can dynamically adjust frequency or RF power depending on the power available.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nXTRX \u2013 A Fairwaves tiny SDR \u2013 High performance Software Defined Radio in a tiny miniPCIe format.\n\n\nnuand bladeRF usb3 sdr\n\n\nhackrf\n an open-source SDR hardware project, as well as some other interesting devices.\n\n\nwikipedia article on software-defined radio\n\n\nGNUradio\n open source SDR software \n\n\nOpenHPSDR.org\n High performance SDR, a completly open source modular design, for the lower-frequency\n    projects (will recieve 0-65Mhz).\n\n\nUSRP\n - Universal Serial Radio Peripheral, one of the first SDR devices to become available to the consumer, developed in the US by Ettus research.

The flexibility of software defined radio means parameters can be changed very quickly to get the optimum transmission for a particular situation.\n\n\n\n\nReducing resources and waste by less hardware redundancy\n\n\n\n\nMaking devices more flexible by increasing the extent to which they are\ncontrolled by software is good because when the device is no longer\nneeded it can be used for something else instead of being thrown away.\nMulti-perpose programmable devices, such as the arduino or raspberry pi,\nare good examples of hardware which will never become redundant.\nSoftware defined radio is likely to gain popularity in the coming years,\nwhich is interesting for us because it is easy to modify for different\nperposes.

A free mobile network using the USRP running OpenBTS\n(with some RF amplifiers) and powered by wind has been set up at Burning\nman festival for several years (But with an official lisence). Of course\nif an unlisenced GSM network was to get popular, we would be likely to\nhave problems with the authorities very quickly.

It could allow us to\ncreate something genuinely independent of existing commerically provided\nsystems, whilst being able to re-use redundant hardware from these\nsystems. Changes can be made to the standards of how the system works\nwithout requiring any new hardware \u2013 saving resources. Frequencies can\nbe dynamically allocated, allowing different types of hardware to work\ntogether and interference with other systems to be avoided\nautomatically. Software projects are also easier to work on\ncollaboratively than hardware, meaning they will be constantly optimised\nand adapted.\n\n\nModulation modes for digital radio\n\n\nOrthogonal frequency-division multiplexing is the modulation system used\nby ADSL, Wifi, and DAB digital radio. Multiple carriers are used, and\nthe idea is that sub carrier frequencies are chosen that are\n'orthogonal' to each other, which means they do not interfere with each\nother. Interestingly it is used even on HF (below 30Mhz) as used by the\nnew international broadcast system 'digital radio mondiale'. It allows\nfor a better signal in less bandwith compared to standard AM modulation.\n\n\n\n\nOrthogonal frequency-division multiplexing wikipedia\n    article\n\n\nMultiple frequency shift\n    keying\n\n    wikipedia article\n\n\nAn Introduction to Multi-Frequency Shift\n    Keying\n from qsl.net\n\n\n\n\nsounds like chaos\n\n\nDecentralised community run systems will, by their nature, encourage\npeople locally to interact, as information spreads geographically. If\nyou are searching for something or announcing that you have something to\noffer, it will be naturally easier to find responses nearby. Compared to\nthe internet, it will be more chaotic, but in a beautiful\nself-organising way.

Compared to wifi networks it is much\nmore practical for recieving in more wild places, fields, gardens,\nworkshops, meaning we can be doing practical things and not stuck\nindoors, while recieving information. Of course there are legal problems with\nbroadcasting without a lisence, especially if it is done in the city.\nBut using it in isolated rural areas is something that can definately be\nexperimented with. As anyone with an FM radio can listen, it can be a\ngood way to make links with other people who live nearby.  However, we must not forget that the nature of broadcast is that it remains a\none-to-many 'shut up and listen' monologue, traditionally used as an oppressive political tood, and care must be taken that\nit remains a project that everyone can participate in.  FM systems will usually use a 1 or 2w 'exciter' to produce the modulated\nsignal and then an RF amplifier. Many modern systems, especially the\ncheaper/lower power ones have the exciter and amplifier all in one box\nor even all on one board. 'HLLY' and similar Chinese brands are like\nthis and are very cheap and simple to use. However they are not very\nhigh quality and not suitable for high power transmissions (more than\nsay 60w).  Also the more power you are using, the better antenna you need to not damage the transmitter.  Most transmitters have a built in SWR (standing wave ratio) meter to give an indication of how well the antenna is functioning and will normally switch off automatically if a dangerously high amount of power is coming back from the antenna.  Some transmitters will need an external SWR meter.   Most low power FM transmitters run on 12v DC so are perfect for running\nfrom batteries. If you want to run from the mains electricity and dont\nhave a transformer, computer power supplies work quite well. If they are\nmodern ATX ones, you will need to connect the green wire on the\nmotherboard connector to a black wire to switch it on. Then on each\nblock of 4 wires you have yellow and black wires to give 12vDC and red\nand black to give 5vDC.",

This means that new radio protocols could be established without the need for new hardware.  But that is only the beginning.  It allows more dynamic, more flexible use of the radio spectrum.

They often produce AC and are usually\nused for powering lights, but can be used for other things too, such as\namplifiers or radios.\n\n\n\n\nHub dynamo wikipedia\n    article\n\n\nVoltage regulated 5v bicycle dynamo light\n    USB\n -\n    plans for a circuit to give 5v DC output (like you get from a\n    USB port) from the dynamo hub.\n\n\nUsb as a power\n    source\n is a good text\n    about powering various things using 5v USB. It is worth also\n    mentioning that its possible to buy very cheap circuits for stepping\n    up 3.7v lithium ion batteries (commonly found in mobile phones)\n    to 5v. Meaning you can use batteries from any old phone to charge\n    other phones or other devices. Could be useful on a long\n    cycling trip.\n\n\n\n\nSolar panels\n\n\nSolar panels are a simple and robust power solution but their production\nis energy-intensive and polluting. They can be stolen quite easily but\nthere are roumours that some contain hidden chips which can be used to\ntrack their position.\n\n\nRegulators\n\n\nMaximum power point tracking (mppt) regulators are more efficient\nbut expensive. Cheaper 'PWM' regulators will allow the battery state to\ndetermine voltage which may not be the most efficient for the panel.\nMPPT regulators use a control circuit to 'search' for the voltage\nallowing the highest power output.\n\n\nAnother advantage of MPPT regulators is that it is possible to charge a 12v\nbattery from 24v panel or potentially a 24v battery\nfrom a 12v panel (works with for example 'emponi sol1').\n\n\nNote that some regulators sold as 'MPPT' are not actually MPPT.  Read reviews of the model you are considering buying, particularly if it seems cheap.  True MPPT controllers can usuallly be identified by a large inductor in the circuit.  \n\n\nOf course when using solar panels it is better to use electrical\nappliances during the day when more power is available. The cheaper\nregulators will even cut out and stop charging the battery when the\nvoltage goes too high (when its very sunny), so its good to have\nsomething connected to use the extra power if this is the case.\n\n\nInverters\n\n\nIf using inverters, it is usually better to connect them to directly to the battery rather than to the 'load' ouput terminals of the solar controller.  This is because inverters will usually have their own system of switching off in the case of voltage becoming too low, and they are designed to be switch at such high currents.  Allowing the controllor itself to switch such a high load could damage it, especially if it is a cheap one.\n\n\nWhen buying an inverter, it is worth looking for a 'pure sine wave' one, but it is hard to know if it is really pure sine wave without testing it with an oscilloscope.  Many cheaper inverters will work fine running lights and power tools, but will not work well with electronics, charging laptops etc.  It can be better to simply use 12v DC (car) adaptor for laptops, phones etc.\n\n\n\n\nbuilding solar panels from cells from damaged solar panels\n many people do\n    this, the cells can be bought from solar panel manufacturers\n    or online. But it is much work.\n\n\n\n\nsoldering without mains electricity\n\n\n12v DC soldering irons, which can be run from batteries, are available.\nBut for situations where you do not have enough power to use an electric\nsoldering iron, a butane gas powered soldering can be used (eg:'Power\nprobe'), which can be refilled just like a butane cigarette lighter. A\nsimpler, but considerably less effective solution could be just to heat\nnails in a fire and use pliers to hold them for soldering.\n\n\nIt is also roumoured that pine tree sap can be used to make flux, which\nis used to make solder flow more freely.\n\n\n\n\nDIY flux comes straight from the tree | Hackaday\n\n\n\n\nbatteries\n\n\nIt is best to use 'deep cycle' or 'leisure' batteries rather than car\nbatteries as they are designed to be dischared deeper. However car\nbatteries can be used if they are the only thing available and it is the\nbattery itself which will be damaged by discharging it, not the\nappliances you attach.\n\n\nOften batteries can be improved simply by adding distilled water.  Open the caps and if you are able to see the tops of the lead plates, you need to add water.  Clean rain water can be used if you dont want to buy distilled water. \nBatteries which appear sealed can often be opened by forcing open a\nplastic panel to reveal little lids to the individual cells.\n\n\nOld lead-acid batteries which will no longer hold a charge can be often\nrejuvinated by pulse charging them to de-sulphate the cells, provided\nthey have not shorted out as a result of a buildup of lead deposits in\nthe bottom of the battery.  There are many designs for pulse chargers available.  A simpler method is to connect the battery directly to a solar panel to give it a burst of power to desulphate the cells.  This should be done with much caution, in best case outdoors, because of the flammable gas which the battery gives off, and of course do not leave the panel connected after dark! \n\n\nAs a last resort, it is possible to use old car batteries which no\nlonger will charge to 12v (which you often find discarded) as 9v\nbatteries, which can power, for example, 3 led bike lights soldered\ntogether in series (2xAAA batteries=3v) to get the last bit of use out of\nthem.\n\n\nLarge 180ah truck-style batteries can often be found in tempory traffic\nlights used for roadworks. However there are roumours that these\nsometimes contain chips so that their location can be tracked if stolen.\n\n\nElectric wheelchairs usually use very good sealed batteries. It could be\na good idea to try asking at shops and companies who sell or service\nelectric wheelchairs for old batteries.\n\n\nSecurity and fire alarms also often have good quality sealed batteries as backup power,\nthese can often be found in abandoned buildings or try asking\nmanufacturers for old ones. The smaller ones will power LED lighting for a useful\namount of time and are small enough to carry in a rucksack to charge\nelsewhere, so perfect for when you have several people sharing one solar\npanel.\n\n\n\n\nlead acid battery information\n including\n    plans for a pulse charger\n\n\nBattery regenerator wikipedia articlue\n\n\nbedini simplified schoolgirl battery restorer\n this\n    is a more complicated motor system.\n\n\nbedini ssg battery restorer plans\n\n\n12 volt gel cell charger plans\n\n\nJoule thief\n\n\n\n\nalum batteries\n\n\nAlum is the stuff deodourant stones are made from.

            "text": "the blockchain\n\n\nOur submission to more automation and control, or the path to a more free and decentralised world?\n\n\nAuthentication by computers has traditionally required a centralised, one-to-many topology.  A bank, for example, might hold a database of its account holders' personal details and use it to verify their identities.  Passwords cannot be checked by just anybody because storing them in multiple locations would make it possible for a single user to have several different passwords.  Decentralised, peer-to-peer interactions on computer networks are possible, but have typically been limited to things where trust is not important.  \n\n\nThis is now changing.  Banks, as we know them, could become obsolete.  But will it empower us?\n\n\n\n\nwhat is the blockchain?\n\n\nThe blockchain is a distributed public transaction ledger, originally developed for the bitcoin cryptocurrency.\nIt consists of an indivisible chain of timestamped 'blocks' of transactions, each of which contains a hash of the previous block.\n\n\nPut simply it is a method of\nauthenticating an individual entity over an untrusted\nnetwork.  This is done by keeping a ledger which is stored on many computers and continuosly accessible to all, and, in the case of bitcoin, timestamped by a verifiable 'proof of work' system.  'Proof of work' refers to being able to demonstrate that an amount of computational work has been carried out, requiring time and computer resources.  Each block is a function of the previous block in the chain, so in order to change something one would have to re-compute all previous blocks.  If there are differing blockchains available, meaning that one of them could have been maliciously changed, the longest blockchain is assumed to be the correct one.  What this means is that the system assumes that the majority of the system is honest, and the only way to undermine it would be to have more computer resources than the cooperating majority.  Rather than trusting the bank, you trust the majority of the network.  \n\n\nHowever, remember that the majority means the majority of computer resources, not majority of people.  Of course it would be much better if it was the majority of people.  This means there is the possibility that a superpower such as the US government might secretly have the computing resources to break the blockchain.  Or if they dont already they might think about getting such a computer.  But a long as there is a financial incentive for mining and a growing number of users, we have a good chance in this strange battle. \n\n\nThe blockchain, as an authentication technique combining a distributed ledger with a proof of work verification system, solves a longstanding problem in computer science, thought by many to be unsolvable.  It is known as the byzantine generals problem, specified by Lamport who imagined military generals camped at opposite sides of an enemy city trying to plan their attack by sending messengers.  The messengers might be traitors giving incorrect information and the problem is to find the best way to interpret messages given that the majority are cooperating.  Bitcoin is thought to be a solution to this problem, offering a verification system which is resilient to a certain level of corruption.\n\n\nThe blockchain is undoubtably an important technological breakthrough, and has potentially very\nmany applications.  Bitcoin is the original project using this technology, a distributed cryptocurrency.  At the time\nof writing the bitcoin blockchain is the most widely used by far, although others now exist with various modifications, and it is quite possible that another will in the future prove to be more popular.  The most notable emerging blockchain project is Ethereum, which is designed to be a distributed development platform, sometimes called the universal computer.  Ethereum extends the application of the blockchain to authenticate not only transactions of currency, but to programmable contracts of unlimited complexity.  Although the bitcoin currency has the potential to make a dramatic social impact, Ethereum takes things a big step further, and is thought by many to be a technology which will disrupt all areas of society.  Ethereum's stated purpose is to decentralise the web.  A decentralised topology is in its very nature, and although some believe it will be slow and impractical to use for certain tasks, the project is gaining a lot of interest.  More recently another public blockchain project has begun, the 'Open Ledger Project' backed by the Linux foundation as well as IBM and other major players in the IT industry.  \n\n\nAs interest in blockchain-based systems grows, many companies are rushing to become involved in it.  Rather than seeing it as a threat they want have control it.  Because of this we have to be cautious.  There are many technologies which have the potential to be liberating and useful but in practice become part of a system which is competitive, individualist and environmentally destructive.  \n\n\n\n\nMelanie Swan thinks the Blockchain will be the game-changing technology of the decade.  \n\n\nBitcoin\n\n\nThere are several good texts and books about cryptocurrencies and the story of bitcoin and its psudoanonymous creator, which place it in the context of the history of monetary systems.  Putting it into this context makes it not seem like such a wacky idea, or rather its not so wacky compared to the financial system we currently use. Fiat currency can be limitlessly created by banks, devaluing the money we have, meaning that by having our savings in fiat currency we put our trust in the banks.  Bitcoin however has a fixed, finite supply.  \n\n\nFiat currency is backed by governments and their militaries.  Bitcoin is not backed by anybody.  Its behaviour is determined by software that is published for all to see.  You do not need to trust anybody to use bitcoin.  Although many are sceptical as to whether it poses a genuine threat to banks, it is an undeniably significant achievement in the struggle of people against banks, the worlds most powerful institutions. \n\n\nBecause of the initial media hype around Bitcoin, it can be difficult to know whether to take the project seriously.\nIt is not until one gets an understanding of how genuinely\ndecentralised such a system could be, to have a secure method of\nauthenticating payments between psudoanonymous individuals\non an insecure network with no trusted third party, that it becomes clear that there is really something innovative here.  Not\njust a new media buzzword but a tool that we now have which was\npreviously unavailable.  Just as the popularisation of\nencryption software such as PGP/GPG opened a new\npossibility for people far away from each other to\ncommunicate in secret, the blockchain lets us do things we\ncouldn't do before.\n\n\nDominic Frisby uses the Rai stone currency used on the island of Yap as a way to explain the idea of bitcoin.  On the island, beautiful Rai stones are exchanged for things.  Some of them however, are too big to be moved, and stand at various places around the village.  These big stones are not exchanged very often, but when they are, it is the talk of the town, and  everybody knows who the stone now belongs to even though it has not moved.  This could be compared to the public ledger of that is the bitcoin blockchain.  Who-owns-what is stored on many different computers and is continously viewable, making the system very difficult to undermine.  \n\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\n\nEnvironmentalists have raised concerns about bitcoin mining.  The financial incentive means that many people run powerful computers solely for the perpose of bitcoin mining.  A considerable amount of electrical power is 'wasted' on verifying the blockchain, and there is no way around this as the 'proof of work' system relys on this expenditure of computing to demonstrate it was produced by a collaborating majority.  One potential solution to this problem would be to use this heat produced by this computing for other things.  One of the difficulties in running large Bitcoin mining computers is keeping them cool.  So they could be used to heat water for example.  We could have computer kettles, heaters and boilers.  \n\n\nHowever, even if this expended heat is utilised, it is still a major disadvantage, especially if we imagine to become independent of coal, nuclear, and the commercially controlled  electricity grid.  It seems we must find an alternative to the proof of work system.  \n\n\nAdvantages of micropayments\n\n\nOne of the major advantages of bitcoin over traditional payment systems is the possibility to transact tiny amounts which are only significant cumulatively.  Transaction fees associated with credit cards and bank transfers make small payments not worthwhile.  Nakamoto points out that it is the possibility to reverse the transaction which makes conventional payment systems costly and uncertain, requiring trust and mediation from a third party.  Physical cash transactions are unreversable, making them practical for small, casual transactions.  Bitcoin was designed to be the electronic equivalent. \n\n\nWider applications\n\n\nThe blockchain could be used to authenticate the ownership of assets such as land, property, cars, intellectual property, as well as more complex applications such as automatically enforced 'smart contracts', for example renting or borrowing , a work contract, marriage, etc.  \n\n\nBeing able to, for example, buy a house without any mediating authority could potentially have dramatic social implications.  Cutting the 'middle man' out of internet-based interactions, changing their topology completely, to direct interactions between peers, and pulling power away from governments and institutions. \n\n\nSome imagine this to mean that we could effectively work for computer programs instead of having a human as our boss.  A robot boss who always follows the rules exactly and who does not need to be paid.  This sounds both utopian and extremely dangerous at the same time.  \n\n\nMany aspects of today's 'work' rely on paying someone just to be accountable, trustworthy and secure.  This can now be automated, perhaps in a cooperative way, where corruption is visible to all.  Thus pulling the rug from under the feet of many office workers, particularly in the areas of finance and law.  \n\n\nBen Schreckinger claims there is a blockchain-based equity market emerging which will mean that stock exchanges and various other financial institutions loose their importance.  He says that this will be considerably more socially disruptive than the adoption of bitcoin as a currency.  It seems that many financial, governmental and other powerful organisations stand to loose their power and significance because of blockchain applications, and Schreckinger thinks regulating authorities are cautious to intervene for fear of being less 'progressive' than governments in other countries, and thereby loosing the edge internationally.  \n\n\nSecurity culture\n\n\nIt could be that 'smart contracts' while very secure\nfrom a technical point of view, could be exploited by\nloop-holes in their design.  Melanie Swan uses the example\nof a grandparent using a smart contract to give an\ninheritance gift to a grandchild either on the 18th birthday\nof the child or on the day of the death of the grandparent.\nThe death could be verified by checking some kind of\nreputable online\nnewspaper orbituary or a registry of death, which perhaps\nonly doctors are able to modify.  It is easy to see how one\nmight try to think of ways of tricking the system, and so\nextra levels of security are required to, for example,\nverify the identity of a doctor.  \n\n\nAnother example is the idea of a 'smart' car which is bought on credit which will not start if repayments are not kept up.  We can imagine other oppressive mechanisms being put in place as more control of different aspects of our lives are computerised. \n\n\n\nEthereum would also have applications for machine-to-machine interactions, often called the 'Internet of Things'.  For example, one driverless car could compensate another for allowing it to overtake or take a less direct route.\n\n\nMore automation and more security culture does not seem to be a step in the\ndirection of a more free and autonomous society.  \n\n\nProjects\n\n\nOpenBazaar\n\n\n\n\nThe OpenBazaar project aims to create an online market (like ebay) which has no centralised server, it consists only of a network of individuals running the OpenBazaar software to buy and sell items from each other.  The rules and regulation of how it works are determined only by the software itself, which is of course open source, making it considerably more democratic than systems like ebay.  Although slightly more tricky to use than ebay, as the software must first be installed, the obvious immediate advantage over ebay is that there are no fees.  This makes it possible that it will gain popularity very quickly, and its decentralised nature makes it very difficult to regulate in any way.  \n\n\nAlso decentralised projects for announcements more similar to Craigslist, have been proposed.  \n\n\nLiftsharing\n\n\nBlockchain-based peer-to peer liftshare software has been proposed.  This is something much needed.  There seems to be a trend in european\nliftshare websites that they start out by allowing the driver and passenger to directly\ncommunicate for free, and payment to be made directly by putting cash in the hand of the driver\nusually at the end of the journey (covoiturage.fr, mitfahrgelegenheit.de).  They become very popular and then introduce a fee and some regulation\nsystem which makes it supposedly more 'trustworthy' but also very inconvenient, requiring\nverified registration, credit card payment, etc.  Then nearly all\nthe users move to another website which is less regulated and at some point the same thing could happen.  \n\n\nThis looks like a job for the blockchain.  The only reason we use these websites is\nbecause everyone else does - the more popular a site is, the likely you are to find what you\nneed.  Whats we need is for the users themselves to talk directly to each other, removing the mediating third party.  \n\n\nAn american\nsoftware project called 'lazooz' proposes a decentralised liftshare system which aims to work in a more ad-hoc way\nthan current systems.  Currently most liftshares are organised a day or two in advance or at\nleast a couple of hours before.  With lazooz it is possible for potential passengers to be\nnotified when a car driving in the direction they want is physically nearby.  This gives the possibility for a\nmuch more spontanous liftshare system,  where you can simply go when you are ready and not have\nto wait for a fixed appointment.  One of the annoying things about taking liftshares as opposed\nto having your own vehicle is not being able to be\nflexible about when you are going somewhere.  \n\n\nHowever, this system, although it might represent a\ntechnological breakthrough, is basically a complicated way of organising hitchhiking.  Does this\nrepresent a loss of trust, a loss of community, that we would only let a stranger in our car if\nthe computer tells us to?  Or is it an effective way to share costs and potentially create a\ndecentralised public transport system?\n\n\n\n\nWe could extent the liftshare idea to an 'almost punk-post' system.  Punk post is a genuinely\nanarchic postal system where you give someone a letter or package who is travelling in the direction of the\nrecipient and they pass it along.  It requires a lot of trust.  In a blockchain-based system\nhowever, 'micro-payments' could be given to add incentive, and items could be tracked.  You only\nneed to move the thing a part of the journey, which maybe you are making anyway, and put it\nin a safe place or pass it to someone else, a step in the direction of where it needs to go.  The\nblockchain makes you accountable for things while they are in your hands, and some kind of\nconflict resolution system could be devised for when things go wrong.   So we could have a decentralised delivery system.  It would still involve money, but there would be no centralisation, nobody in charge. \n\n\nThis could be extended to some logistics/distribution system.  You could drive around in a\nvehicle (maybe your own, maybe hired, or maybe it comes as part of the collaborative\ndistribution system) and pick up a load if it is deemed to be cost-effective to transport it.\nThere could be some regulation and accountability system built in to the software.  The software\nis your boss.  If you don't like the rules, you can make a fork of the project and start a new system.  But the new system will\nhave to gain acceptance by others in order to be useful.  Also, infrastructure such as\nvehicles, storage space or staff-facilities, belongs to the current distribution system itself,\nmeaning the new system will take a long time, or have to be really a lot better, in order to\nbecome widely accepted and thus useful.  Alternatively you could propose a change to the system\nyou are using.  How this works depend on the kind of open-source license the software has.  Since\na change would effect a lot of people there would likely be some kind of regulation system.\nAlthough it is genuinely decentralised, this seems slowly less anarchic than our original idea.  Would you really rather work for a robot boss? \n\n\nDistributed digital storage\n\n\nEthereum has a blockchain-based distributed storage platform called Swarm, where users can host content in a decentralised way, making it resilient to censorship, commercialisation or other kind control by a centralised organisation.  This appears similar to other decentralised content hosting projects such as 'ipfs', 'maidsafe' and 'storj'.  \n\n\n\n\nIpfs (Interplanetary Filesystem), although criticised for being inherently unreliable, seems to have some very promising properties as a universal decentralised filesystem, and potentially a replacement for the web.  Information is retrieved by a content addressing system, meaning popular files are faster to find, network traffic is reduced, and censorship or anyother kind of centralised control is impossible.  It also has a Git-style revision control system, meaning older versions are not lost.  \n\n\nDistributed crowdfunding\n\n\n\n\nAlso using the name 'Swarm' is a crowdfunding platform which uses blockchain technology to sell equity to individuals wanting to help a project.  Co-founder and CEO Joel Dietz speaks in an interview about wanting to disrupt the financial system and to empower people.  He has also appeared on an anarchist webcast program 'anarchast' and said that his influences come from studying early chinese philosophy.  The crowdfunding model differs from other projects like kickstarter in that investors have a financial incentive, more like shareholders.  Selling these equity 'tokens' seems to be a legal grey area.  Swarm promotes an alternative model for business which it calls 'Distributed Collaborative Organisations' (DCOs).  Among the projects using the model is an e-health platform, 'Pointnurse' where patients can pay to contact a nurse over the internet.  \n\n\nWhile these businesses might operate in a more decentralised way and rely less on institutions, they promote casualisation of labour which can dehumanise workers, they are used like tools which are only needed in certain economic conditions.  \n\n\nopen source design process\n\n\nUsing open source principles as a way of designing regulations which control our aspects of our lives is supposed to guarantee transparency and a system that everyone is happy with.  If there is something you do not like you can 'fork' the project, making your own modified version of it, and in principle if you have made a genuine improvement, the forked version will gain more popularity than the original.  These prinicples become more significant as software applications drift into wider areas, replacing legal structures and regulations.  \n\n\nWhat about software which favours individual users to the detriment of others?  In many torrent clients it\nis possible to change a setting to become greedy, downloading from others but not allowing\nuploads.  If everyone did this the system simply would not work.  But of course somehow it does\nwork. \n\n\ntrustless interactions\n\n\n\n\nDo such 'trustless' systems represent a loss of genuine trust between humans which was once the very basis of our communities?  Trust is usually built on social activity, spending time together, communicating, building emotional attachments that mean we care about each other. \n\n\nIs it the case that we need this because our 'communities' have got way too big for trust or 'community spirit' to be possible?  Is there a critical mass by which a society become to big for trust to come naturally?  \n\n\nIs there not something beautiful about genuinely trusting random people?\n\n\n\nCompared to a moneyless utopia built on genuine community,\nthe blockchain does not seem so great, and maybe if you have\nalready found your way to such a community you should stop\nreading this.  But for those of us who begrudgingly use\nsystems which rely on a centralised trusted party, the\nblockchain could to some extent turn the tables on who is controlling these systems.  Potentially we\ncould create cooperative alternatives to banks, insurance\ncompanies, and many areas of government.  But we are not the only ones interested.  Like the internet itself, the blockchain will most likely become riddled with commercial projects.  \n\n\nThe blockchain allows us to collaborate with a wider group of peoples as we are not limited to those we know or trust.  For example we can borrow something from someone\nyou have never met while remaining accountable, with a\nmechanism for resolving disputes which doesn't not rely on\nanything centralised. \n\n\nCollaborating with a group big enough to\nsafely pool a considerable amount of money between each,\nwithout the limit of needing to be a critically \nsmall enough group that they can all know each other well enough to give\nsuch trust.  Money would not sit in storage but dynamically\nand effortlessly \nflow around to where it is currently needed.  \n\n\nBut would this actually abstract the whole purpose of money?\nAn abstraction of the same sort which gave rise to the financial\ncrisis - imaginary money being pushed around?  Bitcoin was developed as a response to this ridiculous situation.  \n\n\nBitcoin, with its transparent underlying mechanism, remains something \ninherently more solid than fiat currency, where banks can limitlessly create more money,\nthereby devaluing our existing money.  \n\n\nMaybe this 'limit' of needing to know each other, of emotional contact, of human touch, is the communication tool which really binds our communities.  Can we really share resources if we dont really understand each other?  \n\n\nIt would be nice to think that a total abstraction of money brought\nabout by such wide scale collaboration between\nindividuals, would form part of a path towards removing the\nsignificance and importance of money in the minds of its\nusers.  Which could be the key to transforming this\ncompetitive and individualist society.  \n\n\nOn the other hand it might just mean more time sat at the computer while our problems of food distribution and access to land remain unsolved. \n\n\nhttp://ameba.ehion.com\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nCox, James - Bitcoin and Digital Currencies - The new World of Digital Freedom \n\n\nFrisby, Dominic, Bitcoin - The Future of Money? \n\n\nLamport, Leslie, Robert Shostak, Marshall Pease, \"The Byzantine Generals Problem,\" ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 4 (3) (1982): 382401. http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/byz.pdf\n\n\nNakamoto, Satoshi, 2008. \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\" http://Bitcoin.org/Bitcoin.pdf\n\n\nSchreckinger, Ben - Bitcoin vs. the SEC (Politico magazine article) http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/04/bitcoin-money-stock-market-000026\n\n\nSwan, Melanie, 2015 - The Blockchain\n\n\nWood, Gavin - Ethereum: A secure decentralised generalised transaction ledger",

Physical cash transactions are unreversable, making them practical for small, casual transactions.  Bitcoin was designed to be the electronic equivalent.",

Cutting the 'middle man' out of internet-based interactions, changing their topology completely, to direct interactions between peers, and pulling power away from governments and institutions.   Some imagine this to mean that we could effectively work for computer programs instead of having a human as our boss.  A robot boss who always follows the rules exactly and who does not need to be paid.  This sounds both utopian and extremely dangerous at the same time.    Many aspects of today's 'work' rely on paying someone just to be accountable, trustworthy and secure.  This can now be automated, perhaps in a cooperative way, where corruption is visible to all.  Thus pulling the rug from under the feet of many office workers, particularly in the areas of finance and law.    Ben Schreckinger claims there is a blockchain-based equity market emerging which will mean that stock exchanges and various other financial institutions loose their importance.  He says that this will be considerably more socially disruptive than the adoption of bitcoin as a currency.  It seems that many financial, governmental and other powerful organisations stand to loose their power and significance because of blockchain applications, and Schreckinger thinks regulating authorities are cautious to intervene for fear of being less 'progressive' than governments in other countries, and thereby loosing the edge internationally.",

Another example is the idea of a 'smart' car which is bought on credit which will not start if repayments are not kept up.  We can imagine other oppressive mechanisms being put in place as more control of different aspects of our lives are computerised.   Ethereum would also have applications for machine-to-machine interactions, often called the 'Internet of Things'.

            "text": "Blockchain-based peer-to peer liftshare software has been proposed.  This is something much needed.  There seems to be a trend in european\nliftshare websites that they start out by allowing the driver and passenger to directly\ncommunicate for free, and payment to be made directly by putting cash in the hand of the driver\nusually at the end of the journey (covoiturage.fr, mitfahrgelegenheit.de).  They become very popular and then introduce a fee and some regulation\nsystem which makes it supposedly more 'trustworthy' but also very inconvenient, requiring\nverified registration, credit card payment, etc.  Then nearly all\nthe users move to another website which is less regulated and at some point the same thing could happen.    This looks like a job for the blockchain.  The only reason we use these websites is\nbecause everyone else does - the more popular a site is, the likely you are to find what you\nneed.  Whats we need is for the users themselves to talk directly to each other, removing the mediating third party.    An american\nsoftware project called 'lazooz' proposes a decentralised liftshare system which aims to work in a more ad-hoc way\nthan current systems.  Currently most liftshares are organised a day or two in advance or at\nleast a couple of hours before.  With lazooz it is possible for potential passengers to be\nnotified when a car driving in the direction they want is physically nearby.  This gives the possibility for a\nmuch more spontanous liftshare system,  where you can simply go when you are ready and not have\nto wait for a fixed appointment.  One of the annoying things about taking liftshares as opposed\nto having your own vehicle is not being able to be\nflexible about when you are going somewhere.    However, this system, although it might represent a\ntechnological breakthrough, is basically a complicated way of organising hitchhiking.  Does this\nrepresent a loss of trust, a loss of community, that we would only let a stranger in our car if\nthe computer tells us to?  Or is it an effective way to share costs and potentially create a\ndecentralised public transport system?   We could extent the liftshare idea to an 'almost punk-post' system.  Punk post is a genuinely\nanarchic postal system where you give someone a letter or package who is travelling in the direction of the\nrecipient and they pass it along.  It requires a lot of trust.  In a blockchain-based system\nhowever, 'micro-payments' could be given to add incentive, and items could be tracked.  You only\nneed to move the thing a part of the journey, which maybe you are making anyway, and put it\nin a safe place or pass it to someone else, a step in the direction of where it needs to go.  The\nblockchain makes you accountable for things while they are in your hands, and some kind of\nconflict resolution system could be devised for when things go wrong.   So we could have a decentralised delivery system.  It would still involve money, but there would be no centralisation, nobody in charge.   This could be extended to some logistics/distribution system.  You could drive around in a\nvehicle (maybe your own, maybe hired, or maybe it comes as part of the collaborative\ndistribution system) and pick up a load if it is deemed to be cost-effective to transport it.\nThere could be some regulation and accountability system built in to the software.  The software\nis your boss.  If you don't like the rules, you can make a fork of the project and start a new system.  But the new system will\nhave to gain acceptance by others in order to be useful.  Also, infrastructure such as\nvehicles, storage space or staff-facilities, belongs to the current distribution system itself,\nmeaning the new system will take a long time, or have to be really a lot better, in order to\nbecome widely accepted and thus useful.  Alternatively you could propose a change to the system\nyou are using.  How this works depend on the kind of open-source license the software has.  Since\na change would effect a lot of people there would likely be some kind of regulation system.\nAlthough it is genuinely decentralised, this seems slowly less anarchic than our original idea.

Among the projects using the model is an e-health platform, 'Pointnurse' where patients can pay to contact a nurse over the internet.

Trust is usually built on social activity, spending time together, communicating, building emotional attachments that mean we care about each other.   Is it the case that we need this because our 'communities' have got way too big for trust or 'community spirit' to be possible?  Is there a critical mass by which a society become to big for trust to come naturally?    Is there not something beautiful about genuinely trusting random people?  Compared to a moneyless utopia built on genuine community,\nthe blockchain does not seem so great, and maybe if you have\nalready found your way to such a community you should stop\nreading this.  But for those of us who begrudgingly use\nsystems which rely on a centralised trusted party, the\nblockchain could to some extent turn the tables on who is controlling these systems.  Potentially we\ncould create cooperative alternatives to banks, insurance\ncompanies, and many areas of government.  But we are not the only ones interested.  Like the internet itself, the blockchain will most likely become riddled with commercial projects.    The blockchain allows us to collaborate with a wider group of peoples as we are not limited to those we know or trust.  For example we can borrow something from someone\nyou have never met while remaining accountable, with a\nmechanism for resolving disputes which doesn't not rely on\nanything centralised.   Collaborating with a group big enough to\nsafely pool a considerable amount of money between each,\nwithout the limit of needing to be a critically \nsmall enough group that they can all know each other well enough to give\nsuch trust.  Money would not sit in storage but dynamically\nand effortlessly \nflow around to where it is currently needed.    But would this actually abstract the whole purpose of money?\nAn abstraction of the same sort which gave rise to the financial\ncrisis - imaginary money being pushed around?  Bitcoin was developed as a response to this ridiculous situation.    Bitcoin, with its transparent underlying mechanism, remains something \ninherently more solid than fiat currency, where banks can limitlessly create more money,\nthereby devaluing our existing money.    Maybe this 'limit' of needing to know each other, of emotional contact, of human touch, is the communication tool which really binds our communities.  Can we really share resources if we dont really understand each other?    It would be nice to think that a total abstraction of money brought\nabout by such wide scale collaboration between\nindividuals, would form part of a path towards removing the\nsignificance and importance of money in the minds of its\nusers.  Which could be the key to transforming this\ncompetitive and individualist society.

The difficult thing is\nkeeping the temperate constant. tempeh needs to be at about 32 degrees C\nfor about 22 hours. Not a problem if you live in indonesia. If it gets\ncolder than that for some time period, it seems it still works but takes\nlonger, eg: on a woodstove which goes out at night but you light it\nagain in the morning. but there is then increased risk of contamination\nwith other bacterias. If it gets too hot the mould cannot survive.\n\n\nelectric incubators are easier to regulate temperature but less\necological and use too much power to realistically run from batteries.\ntypically an isulated box (eg: an old refridgerator) and a heating\nelement (eg: 40 or 60w light bulb). The simplest way to regulate it is\nwith a dimmer switch (this works quite well). but leaving a dimmer set\nexternal temperature changes (eg: at night) and towards the end of the\nprocess the tempeh begins to produce its own heat and the temperature\nrises. Old water heater thermostats can also be used, which can be\nregulated by moving the temperature sensing element closer or further\nfrom the heat source. It would be interesting to know if its possible to\nuse a refridgerator thermostat for this as these are much more readily\navailable.\n\n\nRegulating the humidity is also an issue, a small amount of air\ncirculation is needed but it must not dry out. You can experiment with\ncovering them and leaving a small gap open. Some people use plastic food\nbags with tiny holes in which works well but is expensive and wastefull.\n\n\nAnother tricky thing is how to save the spore so you can make more and\ndont have it keep buying tempeh starter. You must leave the tempeh in\nthe incubator for longer (When you take it out, cut off a thinner piece\nfor more surface area and to not waste the middle part). After about\nanother 8 hours, the black powdery stuff is the spores. these can be\nscraped with something sterile to collect, or just take the whole piece\nof spore covered tempeh and dry it out (eg: on the stove) and blend\nit/grind it to a powder.\n\n\n\n\nkedai perantau\n sell tempeh\n    starter from malaysia, quite cheap.\n\n\nhow to make tempeh starter from\n    scratch\n\n    also recommends books and has facts about how healthy it is.\n\n\ntempeh\n    incubator\n\n\nmakethebesttempeh.org home made tempeh\n    culture\n\n\nwild fermentation\n this site has good\n    forums much info about many kinds of fermentation.\n\n\nGrain mill for grinding the beans: look for porkert grain mill, this\n    is said to be the best.

If this is a\nproblem remember to make enough that you have a constant supply.\n\n\nMaking wine is easy, but making good wine that does not give you a\nhangover is not so easy. Keep everything clean with hot water (or\nchemical sterilisers if you really dont have much water), and 'rack' the\nwine at least once (syphon it into a new container to get rid of the\nsediment). I think its the sediment which causes the hangover. Some\nfruits make more sediment than others, so it can be more difficult to\nget them to clear. Apple and pear wines can be difficult as they make a\nlot of mousse (become frothy).\n\n\nYeast and yeast nutrient can be difficult to find. They can be bought on\nthe internet if there is no brewing shop nearby. It is also useful to\nadd lemon juice, a source of tannin (some black tea, for example), and\nif making a wine from flowers or leaves, rather than fruit, the yeast\nwill like something to live on, crushed or minced raisens/saltanas are\noften used. and sugar is its food.\n\n\nThe first stage of fermentation can be done in an open-topped container,\nlike a pot or bucket, with some textile over the top to stop insects\ngoing in, kept warm and stirred as often as possible with something\nclean.\n\n\nAfter five days, or one week, the wine is filtered through cotton or\nmuslin into another container.

Many\nof us dont 'own' our land, and get moved on, or want to travel,\nespecially in summer when plants need a lot of attention. Gardening\ntechniques work over many years. We have to find the right compromise\nbetween travelling and learning from other places and also wanting to\nenjoy having a garden and eating uncontaminated food. So whereever you\nare, treat the gardens around you as your own, try to keep a long term\nvision even if you yourself wont be there for very long, but respect the\nideas and techniques that have been put in place by those who have been\nthere before. When you are somewhere for a longer time, try to help\npassers by become involved and see how the garden works. and of course,\nsave seeds, swap seeds, when you travel carry seeds with you.  Growing food is often separated from enjoying ourselfs and made into\n'work', it would be good to see more bands/soundsystems playing infront\nof garden fields to motivate and inspire people. you might expect that\nthis would destroy the garden. but we need to break down the barrier\nbetween work and play and maybe not get so wasted when we hear music or\nnot be so orderly when we 'work' in the garden.  Plants which need more attention could be planted on paths we use often\nor on junctions of paths where people naturally meet and make a pause.",

Not a problem if you live in indonesia. If it gets\ncolder than that for some time period, it seems it still works but takes\nlonger, eg: on a woodstove which goes out at night but you light it\nagain in the morning. but there is then increased risk of contamination\nwith other bacterias. If it gets too hot the mould cannot survive.  electric incubators are easier to regulate temperature but less\necological and use too much power to realistically run from batteries.\ntypically an isulated box (eg: an old refridgerator) and a heating\nelement (eg: 40 or 60w light bulb). The simplest way to regulate it is\nwith a dimmer switch (this works quite well). but leaving a dimmer set\nexternal temperature changes (eg: at night) and towards the end of the\nprocess the tempeh begins to produce its own heat and the temperature\nrises. Old water heater thermostats can also be used, which can be\nregulated by moving the temperature sensing element closer or further\nfrom the heat source. It would be interesting to know if its possible to\nuse a refridgerator thermostat for this as these are much more readily\navailable.  Regulating the humidity is also an issue, a small amount of air\ncirculation is needed but it must not dry out. You can experiment with\ncovering them and leaving a small gap open. Some people use plastic food\nbags with tiny holes in which works well but is expensive and wastefull.  Another tricky thing is how to save the spore so you can make more and\ndont have it keep buying tempeh starter. You must leave the tempeh in\nthe incubator for longer (When you take it out, cut off a thinner piece\nfor more surface area and to not waste the middle part). After about\nanother 8 hours, the black powdery stuff is the spores. these can be\nscraped with something sterile to collect, or just take the whole piece\nof spore covered tempeh and dry it out (eg: on the stove) and blend\nit/grind it to a powder.   kedai perantau  sell tempeh\n    starter from malaysia, quite cheap.  how to make tempeh starter from\n    scratch \n    also recommends books and has facts about how healthy it is.  tempeh\n    incubator  makethebesttempeh.org home made tempeh\n    culture  wild fermentation  this site has good\n    forums much info about many kinds of fermentation.

If this is a\nproblem remember to make enough that you have a constant supply.  Making wine is easy, but making good wine that does not give you a\nhangover is not so easy. Keep everything clean with hot water (or\nchemical sterilisers if you really dont have much water), and 'rack' the\nwine at least once (syphon it into a new container to get rid of the\nsediment). I think its the sediment which causes the hangover. Some\nfruits make more sediment than others, so it can be more difficult to\nget them to clear.

But it is also very good when client and daemon are running on the same computer.  If there is a network attached computer connected to an amplifier and running mpd, other computers on the network can\n    control the player by using mpd client software (of which there are\n    many to choose from, i use \nncmpcpp\n).\n    Can run on raspberry pi.  The database is very fast to update\n    and search.  I previously always avoided database driven players because of speed, bloated software, and inability to access my catagoried directory structure where I know where to find things.  Most mpd clients allow browsing by directory structure as well as database, and its playlist management system is good.  The really great thing is, you can decide to change client software without setting up the database again.  Also easy to set up status viewing in a system monitor or keybindings in your window manager, so you can control the player whilst using other software.

For\n    monitoring (listening to the next track to be played on\n    the headphones) it is best to have a soundcard with\n    multiple outputs. Many soundcards have surround sound, meaning you\n    can use the 'front' channels for output and the 'rear' channels\n    for monitoring. A cheaper way to do it would be to use two\n    soundcards, for example your computer's on-board card for main\n    output and a cheap USB card for monitoring. An even cheaper way\n    might be to use the left channel for ouput and the right channel\n    for monitoring. Mixxx also works with various types of midi\n    hardware, so you can control pitch, cueing, equalisers and other\n    stuff with real twiddley knobs and sliders.\n\n\nxwax: Digital vinyl on Linux\n Open source software for DJing using time-coded vinyl (like Serato scratch, etc).  The playback of a digital track is controlled using normal record decks with special records.  Like having every record you ever wished for.

But it would be good to have\nsomething more robust for very rural areas.\n\n\nA way to get around the range limitations of 2.4 Ghz wifi, could be to\nconvert it directly down to a lower frequency, meaning we no longer have\nthe near line-of-sight limitation of typical 802.11. A couple of\nwireless cards are able to do just this. They the take 2.4GHz system,\nremove the 2GHz, leaving 400MHz. On the software side it continues to\nfunction with the 2.4GHz channel system. There is an amateur band just\nabove 400Mhz - the International Telecommunications Union allocates\n430-440MHz for amateurs, and in some countries its wider. However the\nuse of highbandwith data transmission on this band remains a legal grey\narea. \n Singapore based Doodle labs produce\nthe \nDL435-30 transceiver\nboard\n\nand Canadian XAGYL Communications produce the\n\nXC420M\n.\nBoth are mini PCI cards which operate at 420-450MHz and can work with\nlinux wifi drivers. The problem is bandwidth; at microwave frequencies\nthe 10MHz or 20MHz wide channels used by 802.11 wifi is not much, but at\n400MHz it is a big chunk of the spectrum and likely to interfere with\nother things - many common radio controlled devices (for example garage\ndoors) operate on 433MHz. Luckily it is possible to configure 802.11 to\nsqueeze into 5Mhz, of course compromising transmission rate.\n\n\n\n\n70cm amateur band english wikipedia\n    article\n\n\nModifying Consumer Off the Shelf Wireless LAN devices for\n    specialized amateur\n    use\n This\n    article has a section on the 70cm band\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage, compared with packet radio or other data transmission\ntechniques is that the hardware/firmware/software for 802.11 systems is\nalready widely used and needs only modifying slightly. The computer\n'sees' the 430MHz wireless card as a normal 2.4GHz wifi device, with the\nusual channels etc.\n\n\nsoftware\n\n\nThe cards 'appear' to be normal 2.4GHz wifi cards, so not many software\nchanges are required.

            "text": "Build a Pedal Generator from a Cycle-training stand!\n\n\nby Tim\n\n\nIntro\n\n\nI first had the idea to build a pedal generator a long time ago when I\nwas at the Science Museum in London.. there was an exhibition where you\nspun a stiff rotating bar round as hard as possible and if you were\nstrong enough a big bank of incandescent bulbs would light up in front\nof you. That experiment was particularly depressing because it gave the\nimpression that a huge amount of physical energy was needed just to\npower a few bulbs. In fact rather than that, it simply demonstrated how\ninefficient incandescent lightbulbs are!\n\n\nThe reality is that a lot of electrical devices get by on a relatively\nsmall amount of power. Anything powered by batteries will normally be\ndesigned with low power consumption as a priority. Conversely, a lot of\nitems (though not all!) that run off the mains will be quite\npower-hungry.\n\n\nAs a rough guide, a young person pedalling at a gentle rate, just about\nbreaking into a sweat can produce about 50 watts of power. If you were\npretty strong and really going for it you could probably generate 1000\nwatts for a bit, but that's not what we're interested in! It's far more\nrelevant to consider how much power you can produce steadily over a\nlonger time. If you were pedalling a bit harder and actually getting\nsome exercise, that would put out about 100 watts.\n\n\nIf you did that for an hour, you would have produced 100 w x 1 hour =\n100 watt-hours of energy, or 0.1 kWh. Lets put that into perspective,\nwith 0.1 kWh, you can power a 20w (100w equivalent) eco-lightbulb or a\nportable TV for 5 hours ..and it costs about 1p when drawn from the\nmains!\n\n\nIf you're interested in how much a particular device uses, you can have\na look at the rated value on the back or bottom of the thing, however\nthey are often gross overestimates! For example, my alarm clock is rated\nat 7w but draws less than 1w! Your PC power supply might be rated at\n300w but it probably doesn't draw more than 100w.\n\n\nIf you're really interested, you could get hold of one of these meters\n\nhttp://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=38343\n (sometimes they are\non offer). It can give you a reading of the power consumption in watts\nand if you leave it for a period of time it will report how much energy\nhas been used in kWh, amongst other things. It's given some surprising\nresults. Laptops vary enormously in their power consumption; I looked at\ntwo friends' laptops, one used 20w when idle, the other 75w!\n\n\nNote: if you plan to use one of these with a battery-powered inverter,\nI'm not sure if it will work because it is probably designed to work\nwith a pure sine wave power supply, rather than the crude approximation\nproduced by an affordable inverter.\n\n\nGenerator designs\n\n\nThis design is one of many you could follow. Each has its merits and its\ndrawbacks.\n\n\nIf you are after maximum efficiency and you have access to a lot of\ntools and bits and box then you might want to consider making one David\nButcher's pedal generators:\n\nhttp://www.los-gatos.ca.us/davidbu/pedgen.html\n however it's quite\nbulky, which could be a problem for some! This guy is really passionate\nabout his pedal generator and the site is really comprehensive. It has a\nlot of useful and interesting links about 12v equipment and it's really\nworth a look.\n\n\nIf you don't have much spare cash, you could consider using an old bike\nand an old car alternator to produce electricity, perhaps using these\ncomprehensive plans\n\nhttp://www.c-realevents.demon.co.uk/altgen/altpedgen.htm\n However it's\nprobably the least mechanically efficient design around, with a lot of\nenergy lost through the belt transmission and in the alternator, which\nitself is designed to be coupled to a car engine putting out 1000x as\nmuch power as a cyclist!\n\n\nFor me, the design I chose was the clear winner. Here's the upside: the\ndesign is relatively simple meaning that it's easy to make, quite\nmechanically efficient and it can be disassembled and moved about\neasily.\n\n\nThe only drawback is that it could be a little expensive. I'm afraid I\nbought all new parts to make mine, because I had a very fixed idea of\nwhat I wanted. I spent \u00a376 on the training stand and \u00a340 on the motor.\nDepending on your means that could be a lot of cash to part with, it\ncertainly was for me but I was very determined to see the project\nthrough! If you're patient, you can probably get a training stand a lot\ncheaper on eBay, although they don't depreciate as fast as most other\nthings. You could also experiment with various 12 volt motors until you\nfind one that fits your setup and you never know it might come for free!\n\n\nThe idea for the design came from this website\n\nhttp://www.windstreampower.com/Human_Power_Trainer.php\n\n\nIt's a commendable business despite that \\$600 is very pricey for\nessentially a training stand and a DC motor, but in their defence the\ngenerator they use sells elsewhere on the net for somewhere around \u00a3200.\nWhy it's so expensive, I really don't know. Normally I would imagine\nthat you get what you pay for, but my \u00a340 motor has a nearly identical\ndesign and has been generating for more than a year now with no problems\nat all.\n\n\nBike\n\n\nOne of the main advantages of this design is that you can use any old\nroad bike with a quick-release back wheel, just clip it in, adjust the\ncontact shaft height and pedal away. When you're done it just unclamps\nout and you're ready to ride off straight away. No wires or belts or\nfuss or anything like that.\n\n\nThe most important thing is to have a nice true wheel with flattish\ntreads on the tyres, like a road bike rather than a mountain bike with\nbig knobbly treads. I have heard that using a tyre in this way will wear\nit down quite a bit faster than road use but in my experience it's not\nthat bad, just don't bother buying expensive new tyres for this project.\n\n\nCycle training stand\n\n\nBicycle training stand. Cycling nutters use these things to train\nindoors during bad weather. The best type is one which uses a contact\nshaft and a flywheel with a separate kind of air or magnetic resitance\nbuilt in. Some stands don't have a flywheel but it pays to have a\nflywheel as it moderates the pulses of power you put in to the system by\npumping away with your legs, and it allows you to store more energy for\nstarting up tricky devices like cathode ray tubes in TVs (more on that\nlater)\n\n\nI trawled the net for a bit and settled on one of these\n\n\nP00844_BILD1GROSS.jpg\n\n\nit is a \"T1450 Cycletrack Speedbraker\" made by Tacx. This is perfect\nbecause its good for road bike wheels, it has a flywheel and screws to\nposition the contact shaft perfectly against the wheel with adjustable\npressure, something that would take absolutely ages of tinkering with a\ncompletely \"home-brew\" design. A cheaper version (the T1400) is\navailable with a fan unit rather than a magnetic resistance, but I\ndidn't get one because I'm stupid.\n\n\nPower plant - A 12v DC Motor\n\n\nThis is a trickiest part of the whole process. We are surrounded by all\nsorts of motors, in vacuum cleaners, extractor fans etc but they almost\nexclusively run on 240v AC power from the mains. That means we really\ncan't use them to charge a battery, and having one directly powering\nsomething would be really quite complicated, dangerous and hardly worth\nthe risk. Fortunately, lots of 12 volt motors are available because\nthey're used to drive wheelchairs or lift loads on a pulley. A guy from\nBicycology used a windscreen wiper motor to charge their very\nimpressible impressive mobile cinema/stereo thingy (see\n\nhttp://www.bicycology.org.uk/what_we_do/energy_trailer.htm\n) and\nalthough using one of those would limit you to producing about 60 watts,\nthat's not so bad when you consider that you'll probably get puffed out\npedalling much harder than that anyway.\n\n\nImportant: obviously the shaft of the training stand needs to be coupled\nto the motor shaft for the thing to work. It helps if they happen to be\nthe same diameter, because then you can probably get hold of a stock\npart to couple them. See below.\n\n\nThe motor/generator needs to get up to and beyond 12v when you are\npedalling, in order to overcome the battery's 12 volts 'pushing' against\nyou.\n\n\nIn order to charge the battery, the motor voltage needs to go a bit\nhigher; a fully charged lead-acid battery reads about 12.7v and when\ncharging you want to be going at maybe a bit under 15v.\n\n\nThe complication is that when you spin the shaft of a '12v' motor, your\ncontacts won't read 12v immediately. There is a more or less linear\nrelationship between the rotation speed of the shaft (measured in\nr.p.m.) and the output voltage.\n\n\nSo, for example, a motor will be rated to produce 1500rpm when supplied\nwith 12 volts with no mechanical load; It seems logical that if you do\nthe opposite and spin it round at 1500rpm you should get about 12v out\nof it but in practise you would probably get about 9 volts.\n\n\nIf you are having trouble finding a motor, try\n\nhttp://www.motioncontrolproducts.com\n and look at their surplus stock\nsection as you\u2019ll probably find something suitable. My motor came from\nthis company via eBay and I\u2019m pretty satisfied with what I got.\n\n\nMaths\n\n\nAt this point, if you are going to invest any real money in a motor it's\nworth doing the maths before you part with your money. You need to make\nsure that when the thing is assembled the speed that you're pedalling at\nroughly matches the motor's rated rpm. In reality, and particularly if\nyour bike will has lots of gears, it doesn't matter too much if the\nnumbers are a bit off.\n\n\nIf we choose a target voltage of 15v and use the motor rating I\nmentioned before (1500rpm at 12v and vice-versa) - thats 9 volts\nproduced by 1500rpm when you are using the motor as a generator.\n\n\nThen to get 15v out of the generator, we need to acheive a rotation\nspeed of (15v/9v) x 1500 rpm = 2500rpm. (a lot of motors can be driven\nabove their rated rpm or voltage, within reason)\n\n\nThe circumference of an average road bike wheel is about 210cm, the\ncircumference of the contact shaft on the T1450 is 16cm so for every\nwheel turn the shaft is turning 210cm/16cm=about 13 times. If we want\nthe shaft to turn around 2500rpm then the wheel needs to turn\n2500rpm/13=192rpm\n\n\n192rpm x 2.1m tyre circumference = 404 metres /min which is roughly 15\nmiles an hour - a perfect cycling speed!\n\n\nIf this has made you a little hesitant, then don't worry: As long as you\ndon't have to spin the motor really fast (much faster than it is\ndesigned to spin) in order to generate 13-15v, it should be fine.\n\n\nHaving got hold of the right motor, the most taxing part of the whole\nprocess is over!\n\n\nSupporting the motor\n\n\nDepending on the weight of your motor, it might need a lot of support.\nMy motor weighs nearly 10Kg and it would probably snap the whole\nassembly if I just left it unsupported. The best way I found to hold it\nin place was to sit it on a piece of wooden shelf. That gives you a\nnice, flat surface to support it. To hold it in place, I used a few\ncable ties strung together over around the motor and the shelf, with\nsome old inner tube rubber to dampen the vibrations. See the pic:\nmotor.jpg\n\n\nWhenever I set up the generator, I have to support this shelf with some\nfoam or a few towels, so that it is comfortably sitting there at the\nsame height as the flywheel and contact shaft. If its just hanging\nthere, or not supported properly then you are going to damage the\ninnards of the motor.\n\n\nIt would be better to have some kind of adjustable supports (for examle\na bolt at each corner of the wood base, with two nuts to hold the base\nat the correct height).. but I haven\u2019t got round to that yet.\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nLooking back, making this design is surprisingly simple. Basically all\nyou have to do is attach the two shafts and then all that follows is\nsome elementary electronics.\n\n\nBasically all we have to do to prepare the stand is to tear off the part\nthat provides resistance. Mine was in a sealed housing so I just took to\nit with a hacksaw and pliers and yanked it all off to reveal a nice\nclean 10mm shaft, see pic: shaft.jpg\n\n\nNow, you need to find a way to couple the shaft of the training stand to\nyour motor. This could be easy, or it could be very difficult.\n\n\nI didn't have much foresight and I ended up with one shaft being 10mm\nand the other 11mm. I didn't think this would be such a problem but I\ncouldn't find anything mass-produced which would couple them. In the end\nI had to get a sort of 'sleeve' machined for me by the kind guys in the\nmechanical workshop at Leeds Uni. It's basically a cylinder of High\nSpeed Steel with a 10mm and 11mm hole bored down the central axis either\nside, with grub screws along the length of the sleeve to secure the two\nshafts in place. It took them about 5 minutes to make and luckily they\ndid it for free as I was a student, but I expect that it wouldn't be\nvery cheap if you had to have one machined for you! If you are stuck at\nthis point, it could be worth visiting a school or uni with a good tech\ndepartment. Many of them are willing to make something like this if you\nprovide a clear diagram although you will probably have to negotiate a\nprice. The shafts have to line up precisely so there is no way that you\ncould make one yourself, unless you have a lathe! Here's my working\nset-up with the coupling pointed out: part.jpg\n\n\nIf you've got hold of a windscreen wiper motor, there is another\npossibility. The guy from bicycology had done away with the cycle\nstand's friction wheel and flywheel and just made a wooden insert to\ntake its place. He searched high and low and eventually found a plastic\nwheel to fit the motor shaft which was also about the right diameter\n(about an inch) to go with the wheel. Here's a picture. bikology.jpg\n\n\nHaving got the shafts coupled, you're nearly there!\n\n\nBatteries\n\n\nThis is where you will need your multimeter! You might be tempted to run\nyour equipment directly from the motor, but this is a VERY BAD IDEA! The\npower coming out of the generator is too variable \u2013 as you are pedalling\nthe voltage rises and falls and is unlikely to be close enough to 12v to\nsuit the equipment. I found this out the hard way when I connected my\ngenerator directly to an inverter to try and power a TV. As I pedalled\nlike mad to get the TV started, raising the voltage way above the max.\n15v the inverter was rated for. There was a huge bang and awful smell\nfrom the inverter. I had basically destroyed most of the components\ninside \u2013 the capacitors had vented their electrolyte everywhere and\nthere was no way to save it!\n\n\nFortunately, the simple solution is to fit a battery into the circuit it\nsmoothes the spikes in voltage and maintains it relatively close to 12v.\nThe same principles apply in cars - if you disconnect the battery while\nthe engine\u2019s running you\u2019re likely to damage all the sensitive\nelectronics like the stereo.\n\n\nThe size of battery depends on what you are planning to use the\ngenerator for. If you mostly want to power things directly, you could\nprobably get away with a cheaper 7 Amp Hour battery. If you only want to\npower devices directly, you could look into using a 'supercapacitor'\n(with capacitance > 50 Farads rated for 15v) as a way to smooth out\nthe power. If that sounds interesting, check out David Butcher's website\nabove.\n\n\nNote: 7 Amp Hours (normally abbreviated to Ah) means that the battery\ncan store enough energy to power a load of 7 Amps for an hour, however\nyou wouldn\u2019t want to do that because running a Lead-acid battery down to\nbelow a 50% charge considerably shortens its lifespan.\n\n\nA car battery (with about 40 Ah of capacity) is an alright option- it\nmight power some audio equipment for a few hours. But it will quickly\ndegrade and lose capacity if you are charging and discharging it often.\nIf you are planning to do big long pedalling sessions and run it down\nover long periods then you need a battery with a higher capacity. These\nbatteries are called leisure batteries because they\u2019re used on caravans,\nnarrowboats and the like. They can store enough power for a few days\nworth of use and are much more resilient to deep discharges than car\nbatteries (which are really only meant to give a 1-second jolt of high\npower)\n\n\nUnfortunately lead-acid batteries aren\u2019t very environmentally friendly\n(being full of Lead and Sulphuric acid) but there isn\u2019t any real\nalternative. Other battery technologies like NiCd and NiMh have a\nsignificantly higher internal resistance and so more of your energy is\nlost as heat when you are running equipment from the battery.\n\n\nBy the way, it\u2019s an inevitable fact that you don\u2019t get as much back\nenergy back out from the battery as you have put in. Quite a bit is lost\nas a result of chemical processes taking place in the battery when it is\ncharged and while it is stored. This equates to a coulometric efficiency\nof about 70% for lead-acid batteries but this is dependent on\ntemperature and highly dependent on the speed that you are charging at.\nThat means that it\u2019s more energy efficient to generate the power for the\nequipment while it\u2019s being used, and that might be a consideration for\nsome of your devices.\n\n\nElectronics\n\n\nAssuming you have used a 12 volt DC motor, there should be two\nterminals. To connect the motor properly, spin the shaft the same way\nthat it will travel when it\u2019s attached to the training stand with the\nprobes from the multimeter attached to the terminals any way round. You\nwant the multimeter to read a small positive voltage, if it does then\nthe terminal the red probe is connected to is the positive one (and the\nterminal with the black probe is the negative) if you read a negative\nvoltage then swap the probes around. generator-1.jpg Having discovered\nwhich terminal is which, make a mark on each so you don\u2019t forget!\n\n\nThe wiring needed is really very simple, you more or less just directly\nconnect the terminals but obviously it\u2019s not that simple because as soon\nas you connect the motor and battery it will start spinning (this looks\nreally weird) You need to put a diode in the circuit to stop current\nflowing that way (driving the motor) but allows current to flow the\nopposite way (charging the battery or powering something).\n\n\nA diode is a pretty standard part that you can normally get individually\nat a Radio Shack or Maplin. Make sure you get one that can handle larger\ncurrents of several Amps. The one I use is designated [6A80] for 6\nAmps and it has worked fine for me.\n\n\nTechnical note: In fact you only really need the diode in the circuit\nwhile the generator is idle or otherwise generating under 12v. When you\nstart pedalling, for a few seconds you are working to overcome the\nvoltage of the battery (and the diode is preventing current from flowing\nthe wrong way) once you are up to a good rpm and the generator voltage\nhas risen above the battery voltage, then current begins to flow and you\nare charging. Since current is flowing through the diode (in the allowed\ndirection) some energy is being lost as heat and causing a voltage drop.\nThe diode is basically just a piece of silicon so not a totally ideal\nconductor. This amounts to about 5% drop inefficiency. If that bothers\nyou could install a switch to bypass the diode, which you would activate\nwhile you are pedalling at speed (and disengage before you stop\npedalling). However the extra length of wire and the connections within\nthe switch will introduce a small voltage drop of their own, so whether\nit\u2019s worth the hassle is debatable.\n\n\nThis is how the wiring should look, I think the diode is the correct way\nround but it\u2019s quite simple to work out yourself. Be careful not to\nconnect the diode the wrong way round \u2013 if the motor runs you may well\ndamage the diode as the current will probably exceed the rated maximum.\n\n\ngenerator-2.jpg\n\n\nTry to use thickish wire because it has less electrical resistance. When\nusing devices at 12v the current is relatively high and so more energy\nis lost to heat (due to resistance) than with 240v wiring on the mains.\n\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to hardwire in a multimeter to the battery\n(perhaps use a connector block) so that you can keep an eye on the\nvoltage. When you start pedalling the voltage should stay static at the\nbattery\u2019s voltage but as you get up to speed, it will rise and fluctuate\na bit above the battery voltage. As you charge the battery to nearly\nfull, the voltage will be getting higher. You don\u2019t really want to go\nabove 14.4 volts, especially on a smaller battery as it will shorten the\nbattery\u2019s life.\n\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell when a battery is full and you will have to use\nyour judgement. After you have just been through a charge the battery is\nnot at rest so the multimeter readings are not reliable. The easiest\nreliable way to test the 'state of charge' is to measure the resting\nvoltage at least 3 hours after the battery was last charged/discharged\nand compare it to this graph: soc.jpg Note: When you start pedalling,\ntry to get up to speed quickly as to begin with you are pedalling\nwithout a load which can damage the magnets inside the motor.\n\n\nPowering stuff\n\n\nAs I said, you can power things from the battery while you are resting,\nor directly while you are pedalling (although you should keep the\nbattery attached)\n\n\nThe fantastic advantage of using a 12 volt generator/battery is that\nthere is a lot of equipment designed to take 12 volts. Anything that\nwill plug into a cigarette lighter socket will work fine, you can get 12\nvolt refrigerators and TV sets and there are also fluorescent bulbs and\nLEDs bulbs that run on 12v. I think the most useful thing you can get\nhold of is an inverter which takes the 12 Volt DC and converts it to a\ngood approximation of 240V AC mains electricity and gives you a socket.\n\n\nI\u2019ve powered PCs, laptops, a TV, audio equipment, lighting and charged\nbatteries with this (so now my mp3 player is pedal powered too)\n\n\nIt\u2019s pretty cool to be watching TV using energy you are providing\nyourself. Just imagine how different society would be if you had to\npedal for an hour to watch an hours TV - there wouldn\u2019t be any obesity\nand almost everyone would be super fit!\n\n\nThe reality is that it would be very difficult to provide all of your\nelectricity this way. I\u2019ve spent about five hours writing this guide on\nmy PC, in order to produce the electricity I have used in that time, I\nwould have to pedal for about 20 hours! Even with everything switched\noff in my house, it still seems to draw 100-200W which is way more than\nthe 50W you can comfortable produce continuously.\n\n\nI think this makes the point that in order to reduce our impact on the\nenvironment we don\u2019t just need to increase the use of renewable sources\nof electricity or switch things off, we need all of our devices to be\ndesigned as energy efficient as possible.\n\n\nPitfalls\n\n\nDon't use thin wires to connect the motor and the battery because the\nhigh currents will create a lot of heat, wasting energy and quite\npossibly melting your wires. Even the relatively thick leads you get\nwith inverters are often rated for just 10 Amps.\n\n\nAs I mentioned above It's a bad idea to pedal the generator to power\nsomething if the battery is not connected. You can easily go above the\nsafe voltage for a piece of equipment and destroy it. Also the power\nsupplied by pedalling isn't uniform, it fluctuates up and down with the\npedalling strokes making it unsuitable for most equipment.\n\n\nTake care not to allow the current to exceed the rated current for the\ndiode. It's relatively sensitive and if it breaks down you might find\nthe battery motoring your bike wheel around!\n\n\nAnother thing to avoid is pedalling the generator without anything\nattached. I've heard that this causes the permanent magnets in the motor\nto demagnetise, rendering it useless!\n\n\nObviously it goes without saying to be careful not to short circuit the\nterminals of the battery! With all the wires and bits of metal around\nthis can be surprisingly easy and very dangerous. If you're not very\nconfident of wiring up the circuit, you might want to put a fuse in\nline, in case you make a mistake.\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\nThe biggest problem left with this design is to provide support for the\nmotor. Like I said, It's really heavy and it needs something to support\nit. I put it on a wooden platform and secured it in place with cable\nties. At the moment when I want to use the generator I put a pillow or\nsome towels under the platform but it would be better to actually drill\nsome nuts and bolts in to give it some adjsutable supports.\n\n\nUpdated August 2008.

            "text": "I first had the idea to build a pedal generator a long time ago when I\nwas at the Science Museum in London.. there was an exhibition where you\nspun a stiff rotating bar round as hard as possible and if you were\nstrong enough a big bank of incandescent bulbs would light up in front\nof you. That experiment was particularly depressing because it gave the\nimpression that a huge amount of physical energy was needed just to\npower a few bulbs. In fact rather than that, it simply demonstrated how\ninefficient incandescent lightbulbs are!  The reality is that a lot of electrical devices get by on a relatively\nsmall amount of power. Anything powered by batteries will normally be\ndesigned with low power consumption as a priority. Conversely, a lot of\nitems (though not all!) that run off the mains will be quite\npower-hungry.  As a rough guide, a young person pedalling at a gentle rate, just about\nbreaking into a sweat can produce about 50 watts of power. If you were\npretty strong and really going for it you could probably generate 1000\nwatts for a bit, but that's not what we're interested in! It's far more\nrelevant to consider how much power you can produce steadily over a\nlonger time. If you were pedalling a bit harder and actually getting\nsome exercise, that would put out about 100 watts.  If you did that for an hour, you would have produced 100 w x 1 hour =\n100 watt-hours of energy, or 0.1 kWh. Lets put that into perspective,\nwith 0.1 kWh, you can power a 20w (100w equivalent) eco-lightbulb or a\nportable TV for 5 hours ..and it costs about 1p when drawn from the\nmains!  If you're interested in how much a particular device uses, you can have\na look at the rated value on the back or bottom of the thing, however\nthey are often gross overestimates! For example, my alarm clock is rated\nat 7w but draws less than 1w! Your PC power supply might be rated at\n300w but it probably doesn't draw more than 100w.  If you're really interested, you could get hold of one of these meters http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=38343  (sometimes they are\non offer). It can give you a reading of the power consumption in watts\nand if you leave it for a period of time it will report how much energy\nhas been used in kWh, amongst other things. It's given some surprising\nresults. Laptops vary enormously in their power consumption; I looked at\ntwo friends' laptops, one used 20w when idle, the other 75w!  Note: if you plan to use one of these with a battery-powered inverter,\nI'm not sure if it will work because it is probably designed to work\nwith a pure sine wave power supply, rather than the crude approximation\nproduced by an affordable inverter.",

If you are after maximum efficiency and you have access to a lot of\ntools and bits and box then you might want to consider making one David\nButcher's pedal generators: http://www.los-gatos.ca.us/davidbu/pedgen.html  however it's quite\nbulky, which could be a problem for some! This guy is really passionate\nabout his pedal generator and the site is really comprehensive. It has a\nlot of useful and interesting links about 12v equipment and it's really\nworth a look.  If you don't have much spare cash, you could consider using an old bike\nand an old car alternator to produce electricity, perhaps using these\ncomprehensive plans http://www.c-realevents.demon.co.uk/altgen/altpedgen.htm  However it's\nprobably the least mechanically efficient design around, with a lot of\nenergy lost through the belt transmission and in the alternator, which\nitself is designed to be coupled to a car engine putting out 1000x as\nmuch power as a cyclist!  For me, the design I chose was the clear winner. Here's the upside: the\ndesign is relatively simple meaning that it's easy to make, quite\nmechanically efficient and it can be disassembled and moved about\neasily.  The only drawback is that it could be a little expensive. I'm afraid I\nbought all new parts to make mine, because I had a very fixed idea of\nwhat I wanted. I spent \u00a376 on the training stand and \u00a340 on the motor.\nDepending on your means that could be a lot of cash to part with, it\ncertainly was for me but I was very determined to see the project\nthrough! If you're patient, you can probably get a training stand a lot\ncheaper on eBay, although they don't depreciate as fast as most other\nthings. You could also experiment with various 12 volt motors until you\nfind one that fits your setup and you never know it might come for free!  The idea for the design came from this website http://www.windstreampower.com/Human_Power_Trainer.php  It's a commendable business despite that \\$600 is very pricey for\nessentially a training stand and a DC motor, but in their defence the\ngenerator they use sells elsewhere on the net for somewhere around \u00a3200.\nWhy it's so expensive, I really don't know.

The best type is one which uses a contact\nshaft and a flywheel with a separate kind of air or magnetic resitance\nbuilt in. Some stands don't have a flywheel but it pays to have a\nflywheel as it moderates the pulses of power you put in to the system by\npumping away with your legs, and it allows you to store more energy for\nstarting up tricky devices like cathode ray tubes in TVs (more on that\nlater)  I trawled the net for a bit and settled on one of these  P00844_BILD1GROSS.jpg  it is a \"T1450 Cycletrack Speedbraker\" made by Tacx.

We are surrounded by all\nsorts of motors, in vacuum cleaners, extractor fans etc but they almost\nexclusively run on 240v AC power from the mains. That means we really\ncan't use them to charge a battery, and having one directly powering\nsomething would be really quite complicated, dangerous and hardly worth\nthe risk. Fortunately, lots of 12 volt motors are available because\nthey're used to drive wheelchairs or lift loads on a pulley. A guy from\nBicycology used a windscreen wiper motor to charge their very\nimpressible impressive mobile cinema/stereo thingy (see http://www.bicycology.org.uk/what_we_do/energy_trailer.htm ) and\nalthough using one of those would limit you to producing about 60 watts,\nthat's not so bad when you consider that you'll probably get puffed out\npedalling much harder than that anyway.  Important: obviously the shaft of the training stand needs to be coupled\nto the motor shaft for the thing to work. It helps if they happen to be\nthe same diameter, because then you can probably get hold of a stock\npart to couple them. See below.  The motor/generator needs to get up to and beyond 12v when you are\npedalling, in order to overcome the battery's 12 volts 'pushing' against\nyou.  In order to charge the battery, the motor voltage needs to go a bit\nhigher; a fully charged lead-acid battery reads about 12.7v and when\ncharging you want to be going at maybe a bit under 15v.  The complication is that when you spin the shaft of a '12v' motor, your\ncontacts won't read 12v immediately. There is a more or less linear\nrelationship between the rotation speed of the shaft (measured in\nr.p.m.) and the output voltage.  So, for example, a motor will be rated to produce 1500rpm when supplied\nwith 12 volts with no mechanical load; It seems logical that if you do\nthe opposite and spin it round at 1500rpm you should get about 12v out\nof it but in practise you would probably get about 9 volts.  If you are having trouble finding a motor, try http://www.motioncontrolproducts.com  and look at their surplus stock\nsection as you\u2019ll probably find something suitable.

You need to make\nsure that when the thing is assembled the speed that you're pedalling at\nroughly matches the motor's rated rpm. In reality, and particularly if\nyour bike will has lots of gears, it doesn't matter too much if the\nnumbers are a bit off.  If we choose a target voltage of 15v and use the motor rating I\nmentioned before (1500rpm at 12v and vice-versa) - thats 9 volts\nproduced by 1500rpm when you are using the motor as a generator.  Then to get 15v out of the generator, we need to acheive a rotation\nspeed of (15v/9v) x 1500 rpm = 2500rpm. (a lot of motors can be driven\nabove their rated rpm or voltage, within reason)  The circumference of an average road bike wheel is about 210cm, the\ncircumference of the contact shaft on the T1450 is 16cm so for every\nwheel turn the shaft is turning 210cm/16cm=about 13 times. If we want\nthe shaft to turn around 2500rpm then the wheel needs to turn\n2500rpm/13=192rpm  192rpm x 2.1m tyre circumference = 404 metres /min which is roughly 15\nmiles an hour - a perfect cycling speed!  If this has made you a little hesitant, then don't worry: As long as you\ndon't have to spin the motor really fast (much faster than it is\ndesigned to spin) in order to generate 13-15v, it should be fine.

Fortunately, the simple solution is to fit a battery into the circuit it\nsmoothes the spikes in voltage and maintains it relatively close to 12v.\nThe same principles apply in cars - if you disconnect the battery while\nthe engine\u2019s running you\u2019re likely to damage all the sensitive\nelectronics like the stereo.  The size of battery depends on what you are planning to use the\ngenerator for. If you mostly want to power things directly, you could\nprobably get away with a cheaper 7 Amp Hour battery. If you only want to\npower devices directly, you could look into using a 'supercapacitor'\n(with capacitance > 50 Farads rated for 15v) as a way to smooth out\nthe power. If that sounds interesting, check out David Butcher's website\nabove.  Note: 7 Amp Hours (normally abbreviated to Ah) means that the battery\ncan store enough energy to power a load of 7 Amps for an hour, however\nyou wouldn\u2019t want to do that because running a Lead-acid battery down to\nbelow a 50% charge considerably shortens its lifespan.  A car battery (with about 40 Ah of capacity) is an alright option- it\nmight power some audio equipment for a few hours. But it will quickly\ndegrade and lose capacity if you are charging and discharging it often.\nIf you are planning to do big long pedalling sessions and run it down\nover long periods then you need a battery with a higher capacity. These\nbatteries are called leisure batteries because they\u2019re used on caravans,\nnarrowboats and the like. They can store enough power for a few days\nworth of use and are much more resilient to deep discharges than car\nbatteries (which are really only meant to give a 1-second jolt of high\npower)  Unfortunately lead-acid batteries aren\u2019t very environmentally friendly\n(being full of Lead and Sulphuric acid) but there isn\u2019t any real\nalternative. Other battery technologies like NiCd and NiMh have a\nsignificantly higher internal resistance and so more of your energy is\nlost as heat when you are running equipment from the battery.  By the way, it\u2019s an inevitable fact that you don\u2019t get as much back\nenergy back out from the battery as you have put in. Quite a bit is lost\nas a result of chemical processes taking place in the battery when it is\ncharged and while it is stored. This equates to a coulometric efficiency\nof about 70% for lead-acid batteries but this is dependent on\ntemperature and highly dependent on the speed that you are charging at.\nThat means that it\u2019s more energy efficient to generate the power for the\nequipment while it\u2019s being used, and that might be a consideration for\nsome of your devices.",

            "text": "Assuming you have used a 12 volt DC motor, there should be two\nterminals. To connect the motor properly, spin the shaft the same way\nthat it will travel when it\u2019s attached to the training stand with the\nprobes from the multimeter attached to the terminals any way round. You\nwant the multimeter to read a small positive voltage, if it does then\nthe terminal the red probe is connected to is the positive one (and the\nterminal with the black probe is the negative) if you read a negative\nvoltage then swap the probes around. generator-1.jpg Having discovered\nwhich terminal is which, make a mark on each so you don\u2019t forget!  The wiring needed is really very simple, you more or less just directly\nconnect the terminals but obviously it\u2019s not that simple because as soon\nas you connect the motor and battery it will start spinning (this looks\nreally weird) You need to put a diode in the circuit to stop current\nflowing that way (driving the motor) but allows current to flow the\nopposite way (charging the battery or powering something).  A diode is a pretty standard part that you can normally get individually\nat a Radio Shack or Maplin. Make sure you get one that can handle larger\ncurrents of several Amps. The one I use is designated [6A80] for 6\nAmps and it has worked fine for me.  Technical note: In fact you only really need the diode in the circuit\nwhile the generator is idle or otherwise generating under 12v. When you\nstart pedalling, for a few seconds you are working to overcome the\nvoltage of the battery (and the diode is preventing current from flowing\nthe wrong way) once you are up to a good rpm and the generator voltage\nhas risen above the battery voltage, then current begins to flow and you\nare charging. Since current is flowing through the diode (in the allowed\ndirection) some energy is being lost as heat and causing a voltage drop.\nThe diode is basically just a piece of silicon so not a totally ideal\nconductor. This amounts to about 5% drop inefficiency. If that bothers\nyou could install a switch to bypass the diode, which you would activate\nwhile you are pedalling at speed (and disengage before you stop\npedalling). However the extra length of wire and the connections within\nthe switch will introduce a small voltage drop of their own, so whether\nit\u2019s worth the hassle is debatable.  This is how the wiring should look, I think the diode is the correct way\nround but it\u2019s quite simple to work out yourself. Be careful not to\nconnect the diode the wrong way round \u2013 if the motor runs you may well\ndamage the diode as the current will probably exceed the rated maximum.  generator-2.jpg  Try to use thickish wire because it has less electrical resistance. When\nusing devices at 12v the current is relatively high and so more energy\nis lost to heat (due to resistance) than with 240v wiring on the mains.  It\u2019s also a good idea to hardwire in a multimeter to the battery\n(perhaps use a connector block) so that you can keep an eye on the\nvoltage. When you start pedalling the voltage should stay static at the\nbattery\u2019s voltage but as you get up to speed, it will rise and fluctuate\na bit above the battery voltage. As you charge the battery to nearly\nfull, the voltage will be getting higher. You don\u2019t really want to go\nabove 14.4 volts, especially on a smaller battery as it will shorten the\nbattery\u2019s life.  It\u2019s difficult to tell when a battery is full and you will have to use\nyour judgement. After you have just been through a charge the battery is\nnot at rest so the multimeter readings are not reliable. The easiest\nreliable way to test the 'state of charge' is to measure the resting\nvoltage at least 3 hours after the battery was last charged/discharged\nand compare it to this graph: soc.jpg Note: When you start pedalling,\ntry to get up to speed quickly as to begin with you are pedalling\nwithout a load which can damage the magnets inside the motor.",

            "text": "As I said, you can power things from the battery while you are resting,\nor directly while you are pedalling (although you should keep the\nbattery attached)  The fantastic advantage of using a 12 volt generator/battery is that\nthere is a lot of equipment designed to take 12 volts. Anything that\nwill plug into a cigarette lighter socket will work fine, you can get 12\nvolt refrigerators and TV sets and there are also fluorescent bulbs and\nLEDs bulbs that run on 12v. I think the most useful thing you can get\nhold of is an inverter which takes the 12 Volt DC and converts it to a\ngood approximation of 240V AC mains electricity and gives you a socket.  I\u2019ve powered PCs, laptops, a TV, audio equipment, lighting and charged\nbatteries with this (so now my mp3 player is pedal powered too)  It\u2019s pretty cool to be watching TV using energy you are providing\nyourself. Just imagine how different society would be if you had to\npedal for an hour to watch an hours TV - there wouldn\u2019t be any obesity\nand almost everyone would be super fit!  The reality is that it would be very difficult to provide all of your\nelectricity this way. I\u2019ve spent about five hours writing this guide on\nmy PC, in order to produce the electricity I have used in that time, I\nwould have to pedal for about 20 hours! Even with everything switched\noff in my house, it still seems to draw 100-200W which is way more than\nthe 50W you can comfortable produce continuously.  I think this makes the point that in order to reduce our impact on the\nenvironment we don\u2019t just need to increase the use of renewable sources\nof electricity or switch things off, we need all of our devices to be\ndesigned as energy efficient as possible.",

            "text": "Don't use thin wires to connect the motor and the battery because the\nhigh currents will create a lot of heat, wasting energy and quite\npossibly melting your wires. Even the relatively thick leads you get\nwith inverters are often rated for just 10 Amps.  As I mentioned above It's a bad idea to pedal the generator to power\nsomething if the battery is not connected. You can easily go above the\nsafe voltage for a piece of equipment and destroy it. Also the power\nsupplied by pedalling isn't uniform, it fluctuates up and down with the\npedalling strokes making it unsuitable for most equipment.  Take care not to allow the current to exceed the rated current for the\ndiode. It's relatively sensitive and if it breaks down you might find\nthe battery motoring your bike wheel around!  Another thing to avoid is pedalling the generator without anything\nattached. I've heard that this causes the permanent magnets in the motor\nto demagnetise, rendering it useless!  Obviously it goes without saying to be careful not to short circuit the\nterminals of the battery! With all the wires and bits of metal around\nthis can be surprisingly easy and very dangerous. If you're not very\nconfident of wiring up the circuit, you might want to put a fuse in\nline, in case you make a mistake.",
